## Dark Forest (PPC, 90p)

	Description: Someone pre-ordered a forest and now I'm lost in it. 
	There are a lot of binary trees in front and behind of me. 
	Some are smaller or equal-sized than others. 
	Can you help me to invert the path and find out of the forest? 
	Hint: It's about (inverted) BSTs. Don't forget the spaces.
